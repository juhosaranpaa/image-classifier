# image-classifier

Image-classifier is a lightweight image classification project built using TensorFlow and Keras. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 object categories such as airplanes, cars, and animals.

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Builds and trains a CNN from scratch
- Saves and loads trained models
- Predicts and visualizes test image classifications
- Evaluates model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Dataset

The project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes:
- airplane
- automobile
- bird
- cat
- deer
- dog
- frog
- horse
- ship
- truck

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
